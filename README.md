SQL Playground is a powerful web application designed to help users, developers, and analysts interact with MySQL databases using natural language queries. It makes SQL accessible to non-technical users while providing advanced features for developers by leveraging AI-powered NL to SQL conversion with the Mistral model.

## üöÄ Features

- üìÇ **Database Explorer**: Browse and explore all tables in your MySQL database with ease
- üìä **Schema Inspector**: Examine detailed schema information for each table
- üîç **Data Preview**: View actual table data in a scrollable grid format
- üñ• **Query Runner**: Write and execute custom SQL queries using an integrated editor
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered NL to SQL**: Convert natural language questions into accurate SQL queries using the Mistral model via Ollama
- ‚öô **Connection Management**: Configure and manage database connections seamlessly
- üìÖ **Intelligent Date Handling**: Automatically handle date ranges, months, and years in queries
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Use the application smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Processing**: Ollama with Mistral model
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Uvicorn ASGI server

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

Follow these steps to set up and run SQL Playground:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuvakunaal/QueryForgeAI.git
   cd QueryForgeAI
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn mysql-connector-python ollama pydantic
   ```

3. **Download Ollama**

   - Visit the [Ollama website](https://ollama.ai) and download the application.
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     ollama pull mistral:instruct
     ```
   - The Ollama model is now downloaded on your system.

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
   - Optionally : Test via running those testing folder files, to work with CLI

5. **Open Browser** : Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
6. Start using SQL Playground to query your database with natural language!

## üéØ How It Works

- **Connect to Database**: Enter your MySQL credentials in the settings
- **Browse Data**: Explore tables and view their schemas and records
- **Write Queries**: Create and run custom SQL queries in the editor
- **Ask Questions**: Type your queries in natural language
- **Get Results**: AI converts your questions into SQL and fetches results instantly

## üîÆ Usage Example

Ask questions like:

- "Show all customers from California ordered by last name"
- "Find products priced above $100 in electronics"
- "Display total sales by month for 2024"
- "List customers with purchases in the last 30 days"

The application will generate SQL queries such as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = 'California' ORDER BY last_name;

SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100 AND category = 'electronics';

SELECT MONTH(sale_date) AS month, SUM(amount) AS total_sales 
FROM sales WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2024 GROUP BY MONTH(sale_date);

SELECT DISTINCT customers.* FROM customers 
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id 
WHERE orders.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

## üåü Advanced Features

- ü§ñ **NL to SQL Conversion**: AI understands user intent and generates SQL accordingly
- üìö **Context Awareness**: Helps users build accurate queries by suggesting table names and fields
- üìà **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for enterprise-grade applications
- üì± **Cross-Device Support**: Fully responsive interface across desktops and smartphones
